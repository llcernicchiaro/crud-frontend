# AI Agent Management Frontend

This project is a React-based frontend application designed to interact with a serverless backend API for managing AI agents. It provides a user-friendly interface to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on agent data.

## Features

- **Create Agent**: Add new AI agent profiles with various configurations.
- **View Agents**: Display a list of all registered AI agents.
- **Update Agent**: Modify existing AI agent details.
- **Delete Agent**: Remove AI agent profiles from the system.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to various screen sizes for a seamless experience across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite
- **Styling**: ShadCN and Tailwind CSS
  <!-- - **State Management**: (If applicable, add here, e.g., React Query, Redux, Zustand) -->
  <!-- - **Routing**: (If applicable, add here, e.g., React Router) -->

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18.x or later recommended)
- npm (or yarn)

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/llcernicchiaro/crud-frontend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Running Locally

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will typically start the application on `http://localhost:5173` (or another available port).

## Deployment

This frontend application is deployed using Vercel, providing continuous deployment from the `main` branch.

-   **Production Environment**: [https://crud-frontend-henna-three.vercel.app/](https://crud-frontend-henna-three.vercel.app/)
-   **Preview Deployments**: Vercel automatically creates preview deployments for every push to a Git branch (excluding `main`), each with a unique URL. These preview deployments are configured to connect to the backend's `dev` environment.
